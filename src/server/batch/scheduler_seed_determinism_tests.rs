//! Real-model regression test for #347 batched-prefill seed determinism.
//!
//! The first-token sampler draws from the process-global MLX RNG with no
//! per-call key (`fused_sample` takes only the scalar sampling params). A
//! batched cohort runs every row's `begin_prefill` (which seeds the global RNG)
//! up front, before any row reaches `finish_prefill` (which samples), so before
//! the fix the LAST cohort row's seed governed every row's first-token sample
//! ("last-seed-wins"): a seeded row's first token depended on its siblings'
//! seeds. The fix reseeds the global RNG to each row's own seed inside
//! `finish_prefill`, immediately before that row samples, so a row's first token
//! depends only on its own seed.
//!
//! Invariant choice (the careful part). This test does NOT assert byte-identity
//! of a batched (B > 1) row against a single-prefill (B = 1) row. Padded batched
//! prefill is not bitwise-identical to single-sequence prefill on Metal (the row
//! is padded up to the cohort's longest prompt and run through a wider matmul,
//! so f16 rounding differs), which is the documented #203 / #325 / #326 jitter
//! class, not a seed bug. To isolate the RNG variable, every assertion holds the
//! cohort COMPOSITION constant (same prompts in the same positions, so the
//! forward pass and therefore the measured row's logits are byte-identical) and
//! varies ONLY seed values. Seeds never touch the forward pass, so any change in
//! the measured row's first token under a constant composition is attributable
//! purely to RNG sequencing.
//!
//! The measured row is always enqueued at index 0, so it is begin- and
//! finish-prefilled first; the sibling is enqueued last, so under the old
//! "last-seed-wins" behavior the sibling's seed was the live global RNG state
//! when the measured row sampled. That is exactly the dependency the fix
//! removes.
//!
//! Checks (all under the fixed code):
//! - Sibling-seed invariance (the load-bearing, bug-discriminating check): a
//!   seeded stochastic row at index 0 produces the SAME first token across
//!   several distinct sibling seeds. This fails under "last-seed-wins" and holds
//!   exactly under the fix.
//! - Own-seed dependence (positive control, so the invariance check is not
//!   vacuous): the same row produces MORE THAN ONE distinct first token across
//!   several of its own seeds, i.e. the sampler genuinely consumes RNG at this
//!   distribution and the reseed reaches the row.
//! - Greedy invariance (AC #2): a `temperature == 0` row at index 0 produces the
//!   same first token regardless of its siblings' seeds (the argmax path
//!   consumes no RNG).
//! - Cohort-split coverage (AC #1 cohort-split clause / AC #3): a seeded row in a
//!   #332 cohort-split mixed window (`[cold A, cold B, adopted C]`, which the
//!   planner splits into a batched `{A, B}` cohort plus a sequential `{C}`
//!   cohort) produces the same first token as the same row in an all-cold
//!   batched window of the same cold composition (`[cold A, cold B]`). Both sides
//!   run the identical `{A, B}` padded forward and reseed A to its own seed, so
//!   the first token matches exactly; this is holistic coverage that the fix
//!   behaves identically across cohort structures, not a separate discriminator
//!   (the within-cohort sibling-seed-invariance check above is the discriminator).
//!
//! The test loads a real qwen3 checkpoint and runs GPU forwards, so it is
//! `#[ignore]` and soft-skips when the model directory is absent.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p mlxcel --lib --release --features metal,accelerate \
//!     batched_prefill_seed_determinism -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
