//! Stream-selection wrappers for generation-time pipelining.
//!
//! Generation owners ([`crate::generate::CxxGenerator`],
//! [`crate::speculative::SpeculativeGenerator`], and the server-side
//! `BatchScheduler`) create a dedicated MLX stream up front and install
//! it as the default for the worker thread that drives the generation
//! loop. Until that stream was a plain
//! `mlx::core::new_stream(Device::gpu)` instance, which means every
//! owner had to be constructed on the same thread that ran the loop —
//! otherwise the stream would be "owned" by the wrong thread and any
//! `synchronize()` call would target a different physical stream than
//! the one that dispatched the work.
//!
//! upstream `mlx-vlm` PR #1050 (commit `728fab1`)
//! introduces `mlx::core::ThreadLocalStream`: a TLS-backed handle that
//! resolves to a per-thread `Stream` on demand. The generation owners
//! now hold a `ThreadLocalStream` and resolve it on the worker thread
//! at install time, so dispatch and synchronization always pair up on
//! the same per-thread stream regardless of which thread constructed
//! the generator.
//!
//! See `docs/bridge-overhead-microbench.md` for the per-op cost
//! microbench used to validate that this change is at worst a no-op
//! and at best a small per-step latency win on multi-worker
//! deployments where construction and execution can happen on
//! different threads.

// MLX maintains a per-thread stream registry that is populated on every
// `default_stream()`, `new_stream_on_device()`, and thread-local stream
// resolve. Absent an explicit release call, MLX's own C++ static
// destructors free the registry during process-exit static-destructor
// phase — which races with `MlxArray` destructors still running in other
// unwinding threads and manifests as intermittent SIGSEGV / SIGTRAP at
// teardown when multiple threads have used MLX. See MLX `mlx/stream.h`
// `clear_streams()` for the canonical hook.
//
// `MlxThreadFinalizer` is a zero-cost RAII guard registered as a
// `thread_local!`. When the storing thread exits, the guard's `Drop`
// calls `mlx::core::clear_streams()` — freeing that thread's registry
// entries BEFORE static destructors run. Arming is idempotent (Rust
// thread_local storage is allocated on first access), and cheap: one
// TLS lookup.
