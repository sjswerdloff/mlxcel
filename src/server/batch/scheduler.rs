//! Core batch scheduler with iteration-level scheduling and chunked prefill.
//!
//! [`BatchScheduler`] replaces the sequential `loop { request_rx.recv() }`
//! pattern in the model worker. At each tick it decides whether to:
//!
//! - **Prefill** (or continue a chunked prefill of) a queued request,
//! - **Decode** one token for each active sequence, or
//! - **Idle** (block until the next request arrives).
//!
//! When `prefill_chunk_size > 0`, long prompts are broken into chunks and
//! decode steps are interleaved between chunks so active sequences are not
//! starved during prefill of large prompts.
