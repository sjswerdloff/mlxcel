//! Streaming content filter for model-specific structural tokens.
//!
//! Prevents model-internal structural tokens (`<think>`, `</think>`,
//! `<|channel>`, `<|tool_call>`, `<tool_call>`, `<turn|>`, etc.) from leaking
//! into SSE content deltas during streaming generation.
//!
//! The filter operates as a state machine on decoded text fragments (after
//! `StreamingDecodeState` has resolved UTF-8 boundaries).  It buffers text
//! at delimiter boundaries to handle the case where a delimiter straddles
//! two decode fragments.
//!
//! **Supported families:**
//! - Qwen-style reasoning: `<think>` / `</think>` — Qwen3.x, Exaone4, Hunyuan, GLM4, etc.
//! - Hermes-style tool calls: `<tool_call>` / `</tool_call>` — Qwen/DeepSeek tool call format
//! - Mistral Nemo: `[TOOL_CALLS]` — one-shot start marker (rest of output is tool call JSON)
//! - Gemma 4: `<|channel>` / `<channel|>`, `<|tool_call>` / `<tool_call|>`,
//!   `<|think|>`, `<|turn>` / `<turn|>`
//!
//! **Tool-call suppression behavior:** when the filter enters `ToolCall` state,
//! all subsequent tokens are suppressed from `delta.content`. The tool-call
//! payload is accumulated by the caller (routes/chat) and materialized as
//! `tool_calls` fields on the final SSE chunk with `finish_reason=tool_calls`.
//! Partial marker matches at token boundaries are buffered until the full
//! marker can be confirmed (no premature suppression or leakage).
//!
//! The non-streaming counterpart (`tool_calls::parser::strip_thinking`) already
//! handles these families; this filter keeps the streaming path consistent.
//!
//! Used by: routes/chat (streaming path)

/// Split output from [`StreamFilter::feed`] / [`StreamFilter::flush`].
///
/// `content` is text that should be emitted to the client as
/// `delta.content`; `reasoning` is text that belongs inside a scratchpad /
/// thinking block (e.g. `<think>…</think>` for Qwen-style models or
/// `<|channel>thought\n…<channel|>` for Gemma 4) and should be emitted as
/// `delta.reasoning_content` so downstream routers and UIs can display a
/// "thinking" status without parsing model-specific markers. Both are `None`
/// when the fragment was fully buffered or fell inside a tool-call block
/// (tool calls are materialized by the non-streaming parser path, not here).
///
/// `suppressed_positions` counts how many input **tokens** (i.e. `feed()`
/// calls) were consumed by delimiter matching in this call. When a
/// control-token sequence fires (e.g. `<tool_call>`, `</tool_call>`), the
/// matched bytes are drained from the buffer without producing any text
/// output. If the caller is tracking per-token logprobs or other
/// position-sensitive bookkeeping, it must emit an empty-text placeholder
/// event for each suppressed position so that the downstream position index
/// stays aligned with the actual token stream.
///
/// This mirrors the upstream mlx-lm fix (PR #1170, commit `aa4f880`):
///
/// ```python
/// if tok.match is not None:
///     popped = [buffered_stream.pop() for _ in tok.match]
///     for t in reversed(popped):
///         buffered_stream.append(replace(t, text=""))
/// ```
///
/// In that code each element of `tok.match` is one token ID (one token
/// position). The equivalent here counts how many `feed()` calls contributed
/// text to the matched delimiter span — **not** just the number of complete
/// delimiter matches. For single-token delimiters the two counts are
/// identical; for multi-token delimiters (e.g. a Gemma 4 `<|channel>thought`
/// marker spread across two tokens, or any delimiter that straddles two
/// consecutive `feed()` calls), this correctly counts each contributing token.
/// Callers that do not track per-token positions can ignore this field.
