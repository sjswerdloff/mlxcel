//! Boundary-V layer protection (B6).
//!
//! TurboQuant+ measured that the first 2 and last 2 transformer layers'
//! V quantization error contributes disproportionately to perplexity
//! regression: keeping these 4 layers at higher precision recovers
//! 37–91% of the quality gap at zero speed cost. See
//! https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/layer-aware-v-compression.md
//! for the original measurements (LA-V7 policy: q8_0 boundary V, turbo
//! middle V, K unchanged).
//!
//! In mlxcel we approximate the LA-V7 policy by **upgrading the entire
//! per-layer cache mode** for boundary layers from a turbo V mode to
//! `KVCacheMode::Fp16` (uncompressed both K and V). This is conservative
//! — it spends a few extra bytes per boundary layer compared to the
//! paper's q8_0-V boundary — but matches the issue's design hint
//! ("by default, the first 2 and last 2 layers run V at Int8, or Fp16
//! if Int8 not in use") and keeps the K side at least as good as the
//! nominal mode requires (since FP16 is always at least as accurate as
//! any quantized K).
//!
//! The policy is **inert when no Turbo4 mode is configured**: caches
//! constructed with `KVCacheMode::Fp16` or `KVCacheMode::Int8` are
//! returned unchanged regardless of layer index, so existing call sites
//! see bit-identical behavior.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! - `MLXCEL_KV_BOUNDARY_V_LAYERS` env var (also accepted as `MLXCEL_TURBO_BOUNDARY_V` for compatibility with the wording): integer count of boundary layers to protect on each
//!   end. Default `2`. Setting `0` disables the policy.
//! - The count is clamped to `min(boundary, n_layers / 2)` so a
//!   too-aggressive setting on a shallow model doesn't end up
//!   protecting *every* layer, which would defeat the compression
//!   entirely. Negative inputs are treated as `0`. Non-numeric inputs
//!   fall back to the default with no warning (the env var is an
//!   advanced knob; users who set bogus values get the safe default).
